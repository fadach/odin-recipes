    <h3>Pulled Chicken Sloppy Joes</h3>
    <p>I'm showing you how to make what I like to call Sloppy Chickens, which are a cross between a pulled pork sandwich and a classic ground beef Sloppy Joe, except this chicken version is way easier than both of those. And don't let the name fool you, we're not going to need to pull any chicken, since as you'll see, it actually pulls itself. Garnish these with more green onion if desired.</p>
    <h4>Ingredientes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pasos</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle for about 30 seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for the mixture to boil.

        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls apart, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir in the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers just turn tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Taste for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve on toasted hamburger buns.</li>
        
        

    </ol>
